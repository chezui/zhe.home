Hello, Iâ€™m Zhe Cui (å´”å“²). I build things, analyze things, and occasionally break things in the pursuit of making them better.

I like problems that donâ€™t have obvious answers. I like asking why something works, why it doesnâ€™t, and how it could be better. This blog is where I think out loudâ€”about AI, data science, engineering, and the occasional side project.

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around.
