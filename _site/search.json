I build things, analyze things, and occasionally break things in the pursuit of making them better.\nI like problems that donâ€™t have obvious answers. I like asking why something works, why it doesnâ€™t, and how it could be better. This blog is where I think out loudâ€”about AI, data science, engineering, and the occasional side project.\nIf any of that sounds interesting, stick around.\nIâ€™m always interested in connecting with like minded folks: feel free to reach me on X and LinkedIn."
